In wireshark, HTTPS traffic cannot be decrypted unless you have a encrypted log file.
If no such file exists when a PCAP is recorded you cannot decrypt HTTPS traffic in a PCAP.

Remember: To find HTTPS traffic use ssl.handshake.type == 1 or tls.handshake.type eq 1

To Decrypt HTTPS Traffic and load key file: edit --> Preferences --> Protocols --> TLS --> Pre Master Secret Log Filename --> OK
	Input your logfile in the pre-master log filename field.

Once this is done you should be able to see the hidden HTTP/HTTPS traffic and export malware from the PCAP.
View HTTP traffic by right clicking packet and viewing HTTP Stream.
Use File, CertUtil and Shasum to verify integrity of files to verify if it is malware. You can do this by checking sites like virustotal.com
